###Description
Market INIK is a multi vendor e-commerce mobile app, that will help the haitians's students willing to envolve their business but don't have enough money to pay for the services(digital marketing) to reach 
their entreprise at the top to be competitive to the others. Even if the target is the students, others people will have access to create a seller account.
